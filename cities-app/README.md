Input: The Cities App is easy and intuitive for users to add and see cities. Simply fill out a short form with the city name, country, and population to add a new
city. Want to learn more about a city? Simply click on it to see its details! Page switching is smooth and seamless with React Router, so users can switch between
pages with ease. Also, after you've added a city, the app itself takes you back to the cities list automatically, so the process is easy and friendly.

Process: The moment the users type a new city, the app handles the input effectively and refreshes the list in real time. Thanks entirely to React's useState, the
city list refreshes automatically, with everything remaining up to date without the need for a page reload. Each city entered gets assigned an ID and stored in the
app state. Tapping on a city unfolds its details using useParams, while useNavigate allows easy navigation between pages. With instant notifications and seamless
transitions, it is simple to interact with the app.

Output: The app keeps the users informed with simple and prompt feedback. When a new city is entered, the list changes instantly. Pressing a city shows its data,
including country and population, so it is easy to scroll through information. The simple, easy-to-navigate interface gives smooth navigation with instant screen
shifts. With a simple but rational design, the users can navigate through, add, and view city information with ease.
